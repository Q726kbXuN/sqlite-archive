# SQLite Archive

This is an archive of files from sqlite.org.

sqlite.org still hosts most of these files, but finding them on the website isn't straight forward, and often they're useful for debugging an issue with historical versions of SQLite, so this repo gathers the versions and organizes them for easy scripting.
